# Stranger Hunt

## How to set up your workspace

Your instructor will provide a link to a GitHub Classroom invitation for this assignment. When you click the link, Classroom creates a new copy of this repo at github.com, with your username added to the end of the repo name.

To work with your new repo in a c9 workspace, click the green `Clone or download` button at github.com, then copy the URL to your clipboard. In your c9 workspace, use a terminal to clone the repository.

**CAUTION!** When the terminal prompt ends with the string `(master)`, you are in a folder that is already part of some git repository. Do **not** clone a repository into such folders, or you will create a tangled mess. In most cases, you want to run the clone command when your terminal prompt shows that you are in `~/workspace`.

The clone command is: `git clone --recurse-submodules <PASTE URL>`, where `<PASTE URL>` is a placeholder for you repo's URL, which you can paste from your clipboard. 

## How to complete the assignment

In your c9 workspace, you will implement the Stranger Hunt game by following instructions TBD.

## Submitting your work

You should submit your *progress* to github.com *each time* that you work on this assignment. (Don't wait until you are finished to submit.)

To submit your latest work, use c9's file navigator (in the `Workspace` tab on the left) to find `github-tools/sync.sh`. Right-click the file and click `Run`. 

You should see a `Run` tab in the console pane at the bottom of the screen. (If you do not, try pressing `F6`, or choosing `Console` from the `View` menu.) If it asks for your github.com password, click to activate the console, type the password, and press `Enter`. (No characters will appear as you type the password.) If all goes well, the `Run` tab should display the following message. 

```bash
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
 
If you encounter any problems with the submit process, capture a screen shot that includes contents of the `Run` tab and email it to your instructor.
